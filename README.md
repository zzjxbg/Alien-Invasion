# Alien-Invasion
---------------
introduction
--------------
This is my EE551 python individual project | Author: Zijie Zhao

proposals
--------------
This project is a funny shooting game. I'll develop a number of files that work together to create a functioning game. I'll use pygame, a collection of fun, powerful python modules that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for us to build sophisticated games.

Game Description
---------------
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens.If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous one.If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.If the player loses three ships,the game ends.
